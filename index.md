I received my Master degree in Vision and Robotics ([VIBOT](https://www.vibot.org/), Erasmus mundus) from the [University of Burgundy](https://en.u-bourgogne.fr/) in 2012. I completed my PhD degree in November 2016 supervised by Prof. [Ludovic Macaire](https://pro.univ-lille.fr/ludovic-macaire), and Dr. [Luc Duvieubourg](https://pro.univ-lille.fr/luc-duvieubourg). It is an Industrial PhD under [CIFRE ANRT](https://euraxess.ec.europa.eu/jobs/funding/cifre-fellowships) funding between [French Railway Company (SNCF)](https://www.sncf-reseau.com/en/innovation) and [University of Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr/). Prior and during the PhD, I work as a R&D Engineer in the simulation, and development of 3D vision system for high speed railway maintenance. 


In 2017, I joined [Nokia Technologies](https://www.nokia.com/) as a full time senior scientist in Tampere, Finland. I am nowadays working on 3D computer vision prototypes for present and future Nokia products. I also provide technical consultations in Standards (MPEG, 3GPP).
