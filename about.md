I joined [Nokia Technologies](https://www.nokia.com/) in 2017 as a Senior Scientist, where I currently work on **real-time 3D computer vision and volumetric media systems** for present and next-generation Nokia products.  
My work spans **volumetric capture, rendering, compression, and streaming**, with a strong focus on **deployable, standards-aligned XR systems**.  
I also contribute technical expertise to international standardization activities, including **MPEG** and **3GPP**.

I received my Master’s degree in Vision and Robotics through the Erasmus Mundus **[VIBOT](https://www.vibot.org/)** programme from the [University of Burgundy](https://en.u-bourgogne.fr/) in 2012.  
I completed my PhD in Computer Vision in November 2016 at the [University of Lille](https://www.univ-lille.fr/), supervised by Prof. [Ludovic Macaire](https://pro.univ-lille.fr/ludovic-macaire) and Dr. [Luc Duvieubourg](https://pro.univ-lille.fr/luc-duvieubourg).

My doctoral work was an **industrial PhD (CIFRE ANRT)** conducted in collaboration with the [French National Railway Company (SNCF)](https://www.sncf-reseau.com/en/innovation), focusing on **3D vision-based measurement systems** for high-speed railway inspection.  
Before and during my PhD, I worked as an R&D Engineer on **simulation, calibration, and development of industrial 3D vision systems** for railway maintenance applications.
