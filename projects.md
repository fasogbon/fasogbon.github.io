		<!--In this collaboration wi.............ose a real-time marker-less system to see through cars. For this purpose, two cars are equipped with cameras and an appropriate wireless communication system. The stereo vision system mounted on the front car allows to create a sparse 3D map of the environment where the rear car can be localized. Using this inter-car pose estimation, a synthetic image is generated to overcome the occlusion and to create a seamless see-through effect which preserves the structure of the scene.

		<!--We also proposed an extension of the two car see-through system for an arbitrary number of vehicle. Specifically, we created a multi-vehicle localization approach relying exclusively on cameras installed on connected cars (i.e. vehicles with Internet access). The proposed method is designed to perform in real-time while requiring a low bandwidth connection as a result of an efficient centralized/decentralized architecture. Hence, our approach is compatible with both LTE Internet connection and local WIFI networks. To reach this goal, the vehicles share small portions of their respective 3D maps to estimate their relative positions. The global consistency between multiple vehicles is enforced via a novel graph-based strategy. This work is still under review for a journal publication.

<h3 class="post-title">Generative AI Microstructure</h3>
        <p> 
		<!--In this paper, we present MC-Calib, a novel and robust toolbox dedicated to the calibration of complex synchronized multi-camera systems using an arbitrary number of fiducial marker-based patterns. Calibration results are obtained via successive stages of refinement to reliably estimate both the poses of the calibration boards and cameras in the system. Our method is not constrained by the number of cameras, their overlapping field-of-view (FoV), or the number of calibration patterns used. Moreover, neither prior information about the camera system nor the positions of the checkerboards are required. As a result, minimal user interaction is needed to achieve an accurate and robust calibration which makes this toolbox accessible even with limited computer vision expertise. In this work, we put a strong emphasis on the versatility and the robustness of our technique. Specifically, the hierarchical nature of our strategy allows to reliably calibrate complex vision systems even under the presence of noisy measurements. Additionally, we propose a new strategy for best-suited image selection and initial parameters estimation dedicated to non-overlapping FoV cameras. Finally, our calibration toolbox is compatible with both, perspective and fisheye cameras. Our solution has been validated on a large number of real and synthetic sequences including monocular, stereo, multiple overlapping cameras, non-overlapping cameras, and converging camera systems. <a href="https://github.com/rameau-fr/MC-Calib">[Project]</a>.-->
